# project-1

People all across the world are worried about the coronavirus. For our first project our group decided to make a web application that allows users to search statistics by country & find online news articles that are relevant to them. Our application informs individuals on various coronavirus statistics such as cases, recovered individuals, and deaths. We hope to expand on this application & hope it provides value to its users!
