## Objective:

To create an app as a team relevant to interests of the group.

## Rationale:

Because people all across the world are worried about the coronavirus, our team decided to develop a web application that puts relevant information about the virus together in one place. The user will be able to search statistics by country and find online news articles that are relevant to COVID-19. 

## What We Used:
1. APIs:
    a. New York Times 
    b. https://corona.lmao.ninja/countries (COVID-19 by country)
2. HTML/CSS
3. JavaScript
4. jQuery
5. AJAX
6. CDNs



## Team Members:
1. Zachary Sievers
